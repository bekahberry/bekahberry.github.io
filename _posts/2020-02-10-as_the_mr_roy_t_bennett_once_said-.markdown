And that is exactly what I am *not* good at doing. 

My whole life I've been hiding. Too insecure to try and push myself, and too much of a delicate ego to understand that with failure comes progress, if you don't give up of course. 

I grew up learning in not the most positivd of enviroment which lead to me constantly finding myself stuck in my own anxiety ridden "what ifs" of thoughts and self doubt. I did, and still do, have problems only thinking about the worse case scenario in everything and because of that, I have limited myself to a very small window of 'success'. 

Which leads to me to where I have been for the past five years-- a mangement postion that is as stagnant as the enviroment that it breeds as a whole and this has only pushed this passive mindset of mine further leaving me to think this is all I may be able to contribute. 

I want to push myself, get uncomfortable, learn how to properly *learn*.  
Ask questions, dive deeper into concepts and reset my idea of what it takes to tackle something drastically new to myself and make something out of it in the end and code has been the perfect challenge.
I love how supportive the community has been so far and I love the fact that the developer world is a field that you must stay flexible in your learning and always be willing to expand your understanding.
It encourages and reminds you that a growth mindset is the only way to find success in all aspects of your life. 


So I signed up for this bootcamp. A wild outlandish idea I'm not even sure how I convinced myself to click the request button to begin with but I did. And for some crazy reason I'm here now, on day one of the start of my biggest change yet. I would be lying if I told you I wasn't terrified of this new process. 
However, this here blog is to remind myself that I cannot allow the anxiety of all this change ruin this fantastic opportunity before I even try. 

So folks- here's to new adventures.
